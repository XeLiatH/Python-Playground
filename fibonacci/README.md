# Fibonacci sequence

> [Reference link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number)

It is a sequence going as such `0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13` and so on. It is defined as <code>F<sub>n</sub> = F<sub>n-1</sub> + F<sub>n-2</sub></code>.

I tried to use multiple approaches:

* Recursion
* [Dynamic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming#Examples:_Computer_algorithms)
  * Memoize
  * Bottom-up
